##Appendix 2: Digital Signage Procedures

Always check the online resource for [digital signage](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/About-the-GC/Administrative-Services/Communications-Marketing/Resources/Digital-Signage-Templates) for latest updates. It may be helpful to download a fresh template each time to reduce errors in formatting. 

###Best Practices

- Download new template from [website](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/About-the-GC/Administrative-Services/Communications-Marketing/Resources/Digital-Signage-Templates)
- You must have both A and B slide templates, and complete designs for both.
- Design poster according to guidelines mentioned in **Publicity** to include eye-catching photo, speaker information, event title, time/date/location, cuny.is shortlink, and hashtag.
- For ideas, sample digital signage is available from Mary Catherine Kinniburgh. 
- Once design is completed, **SAVE** slide as a high-quality .jpg or .png file
- **COPY AND PASTE** the image file into a **NEW TEMPLATE SLIDE** and save: this file will be what you submit to Communcations.

*Saving the file as an image and placing it the slide reduces errors in background formatting and ensures slide with render correctly on GC screens. This workflow is a result of multiple conversations between Mary Catherine Kinniburgh and Communications in Fall 2015.*

###Sample Email for Digital Signage
*once sign has been approved by Lisa*

to: digital_signs@gc.cuny.edu

title: Digital Signage Request

To Communications and Marketing,

I am writing to see if you might share following flier, which advertises the [*event name*]. We would love to have the flier posted in the Elevator Lobby display cases on the 3rd-7th floor, the main lobby, and at the entrance to the Dining Commons.

I have attached the slides in the templates necessary for these locations [*include both template a and b*]; please let me know if there are any formatting issues.

We would very much appreciate having these signs posted until [*day after event is scheduled*].

Thank you so much in advance for your assistance.

My best,

[*Name*]
